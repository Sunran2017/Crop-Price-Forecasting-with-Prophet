# Crop-Price-Forecasting-with-Prophet
The objective of this project is to predict the crop prices for next 30 years. 
The time for corn, soybean and wheat price data are from 1992 to 2019, 1998 to 2019 and 2004 to 2019, representively.
To consider the relationship between these three main grain crops growing in eastern Canada, the ratio of soybean and wheat to corn price are used to predict soybean and wheat prices.
